            VoxRen is a voxel-based pathtracer with support for real-time
            editing of the scene and multiple material types. By using GPU
            acceleration (with OpenCL), the pathtracing takes place in
            real-time. The program also contains a full GUI that helps the user
            easily modify the scene, and a Python module was also written so
            that a scene can also be easily created using scripts.
          </p>

          <p>
            All GPU-side code was written using OpenCL so that it would run on a
            wider range of hardware, like my laptop (with Intel Iris integrated
            graphics), compared to CUDA. On the other hand, most CPU-side code
            (the GUI and various other processes) was written in C, except the
            scene-generation code that was written in Python.
          </p>

          <p>
            The GUI was implemented using
            <a class="basic-link" href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a>, a
            library that provides a large number of graphics related features
            aimed at game development. All GUI components (windows, buttons,
            text-inputs) were implemented from scratch using basic features from
            this library. Although the GUI is far from perfect, building an
            entire GUI system from scratch taught me a lot about GUIs and
            graphics in general. This is a screenshot of the GUI in action:
          </p>

          <img
            class="image"
            src="assets/project_images/voxren_gui.jpeg"
            alt="gui showcase"
          />

          <p>The GUI allows the user to perform a number of actions such as:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Select a material type, color, and properties, and place it in the
              scene using the mouse
            </li>
            <li>
              Set various camera parameters, such as position orientation,
              exposure, etc
            </li>
            <li>Change the color and brightness of the background</li>
            <li>Change the movement speed and mouse sensitivity</li>
          </ul>

          <p>And many more.</p>

          <p>
            The Python module can be used in scripts to easily create large
            scenes, to visualize some mathematical model, or to visualize data.
            For example using heightmap data of the Earth, I was able to make a
            3D map of Spain:

            src="assets/project_images/voxren_spain_gui.jpeg"
            alt="spain"
          />

          <p>Finally, here are some renders I made using VoxRen:</p>

          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="footer"></div>
    </div>

    <script>
      $(function () {
        $("#header").load("shared/header.html");
        $("#footer").load("shared/footer.html");
      });
    </script>

    <script src="scripts/shared/highlight_item.js"></script>
  </body>
