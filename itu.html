					imageToUnicode is a C / python library I'm working on that extends the idea behind
					<a class="basic-link" href="ptmv">ptmv</a>, and it aims to display more complex images using unicode
					characters. I am eventually planning to improve ptmv using
					this library.
				</p>

				<p>
					The main difference between the graphics used in ptmv and imageToUnicode is that while ptmv only
					uses that unicode character "▄", imageToUnicode uses the following 19 characters:
				</p>

				<div class="codeblock">
					▁ ▂ ▃ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ <br><br>
					▏ ▎ ▌ ▍ ▋ ▊ ▉ <br><br>
					▝ ▘ ▗ ▖ ▚
				</div>

				<p>
					Using these characters, imageToUnicode is able to find the best match for a particular cluster of
					pixels, improving the accuracy of the final output.
				</p>

				<p>
					Because the final goal of this project is to improve ptmv, performance is an important factor, as
					ptmv is also used to play videos. This is the main reason that the main algorithm is written in C.
					As well as being much faster than python, C also provides direct control over memory, greatly
					reducing the number of wasteful operation performed. In addition, C supports true multithreading,
					which is the main method I used to improve performance.
				</p>

				<p>
					Multithreading was easy to implement for each row of the output image, as this has a good balance
					between the number of threads and the time it takes to initialize a thread.
				</p>

				<p>
					It is also possible to choose the level of detail wanted in the final output. This is done by
					restricting the number of characters allowed to be used from 19 to some specified number. The lowest
					level of detail uses a single character "▄", thus outputting the same image as the current
					implementation of ptmv.
				</p>

				<p>
					Here is a comparison between detail levels:
				</p>

				<div class="codeblock">detail = 0 (1 character used), same as ptmv</div>

				<img class="image" src="assets/project_images/itu_detail0.png" alt="detail level 0">

				<div class="codeblock">detail = 3 (6 character used)</div>

				<img class="image" src="assets/project_images/itu_detail3.png" alt="detail level 3">

				<div class="codeblock">detail = 6 (19 character used)</div>

				<img class="image" src="assets/project_images/itu_detail6.png" alt="detail level 6">

				<p>
					As shown, at a detail level of 6, the image is extremely sharp, considering the fact that the entire
					image is made up of characters. Although the detail level can be lowered, with the optimizations
					currently implemented, the imageToUnicode can process images at fps suitable for ptmv.
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally, here is what the image shown above (detail = 6) looks like without any colors:
